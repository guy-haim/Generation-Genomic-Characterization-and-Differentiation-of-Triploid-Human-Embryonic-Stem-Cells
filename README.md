# A comparison of triploid hESCs with haploid and diploid hESCs:
RNA-seq analysis of diploid and triploid hESCs, which includes e-Karyotype analysis, differential expresion analysis, PCA, GSEA and difference in expression of membrane and nuclear proteins.
Genome-wide promoters' methylation analysis of haploid, diploid and triploid hESCs.
Cell size comparison of haploid, diploid and triploid hESCs.
CRISPR-Score analysis of hESCs and neural progenitor cells.

# A differentiation analysis of diploid and triploid cells by transcriptome:
RNA-seq analysis of diploid and triploid teratomas, which includes differential expresion analysis, PCA, GSEA and difference in lineage-specific gene expression.
